# Climate-Change-using-Machine-Learning

Problem Statement:
The objective of this project was to analyze climate change data to uncover key patterns and trends. The challenge involved processing and analyzing a substantial dataset to generate accurate predictions and insights into climate variables.

Approach:
I spearheaded a team of four in the laboratory to tackle this project. We processed and cleaned over 30,000 data points using Excel and Python libraries. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted with Matplotlib and Seaborn to reveal key climate patterns, followed by feature scaling to prepare the data for modeling.

We trained and evaluated over ten machine learning models, assessing their accuracy, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and RÂ² scores. Through meticulous model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and k-fold cross-validation, we optimized the performance of the models.

Conclusion:
The project achieved a remarkable 93% accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in analyzing climate change data. The combination of thorough data processing, robust modeling techniques, and careful evaluation provided valuable insights into climate patterns and trends.
